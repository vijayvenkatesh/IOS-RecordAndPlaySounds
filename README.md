# IOS-RecordAndPlaySounds

A simple IOS App that lists a directory of sounds, allows you to record new ones and play back.

I want to tinker with the NSAudio Package to look at frequency settings, speed of playback and add some options.

To Use:
1. Check out the repository
2. Make sure you have Xcode 6 or greater. All the code is in swift not Objective C
3. Build and run. For Working with Audio settings look at SoundListViewController.swift and NewSoundViewController.swift
4. Have fun watching your kids play with this app.
